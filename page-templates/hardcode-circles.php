                        Dear MITCNC members:
                    </b>
                    <p>
                        Our lives are filled with challenges, dilemmas, stresses, and hard-won lessons.
                        If you would like to have a group of trusted MIT Alums to serve as a personal board of directors
                        or brain trust, read on.
                    <p>
                        MIT Circles are groups of 7-10 NorCal MIT Alums in similar career or life stages who meet
                        regularly to help one another grow professionally and personally. Participants will have the
                        opportunity to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reflect on questions and ideas with a smart and thoughtful group of fellow MIT alums&mdash;outside
                            of existing social and professional circles
                        <li>Get unbiased advice on difficult topics from a group focused on providing mutual support
                        <li>Form long-lasting connections with a trusted and respected group of peers
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This initiative requires participants to commit to 1-hour, virtual meetups every two weeks
                        over a six-month period (meetup schedules TBD based on participantsâ€™ availabilities).

                    <ul>
                        <li>MIT Circles aims to help us navigate our careers, professional growth, and personal lives by
                            sharing and receiving advice and perspectives from our very own personal board of directors
                            composed of trusted like-minded peer-friends. Some of the organizers have been / are
                            involved in similar groups and have found it to be rewarding and valuable so we want to
                            offer a similar experience to the MIT alumni audience.

                        </li>

                        <li>MIT Circles is based on concepts like <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/true-north-groups">True

                            that his True North Group has helped him to &ldquo;become more self-aware and open [and]
                            take risks with significant challenges.&rdquo;
                        </li>
                        <li>Many successful individuals have found participation in similar groups to be some of the
                            most impactful and rewarding experiences of their lives.
                        </li>

                    <p>MIT Circles will provide you with the opportunity to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reflect on questions and ideas with a smart and thoughtful group of fellow MIT alums -
                            outside of existing social circles

                            had meaningful discussions over the course of months

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Who will be in my group?</span>
                    <p>Each group will include 7-10 MIT Alums in similar career and life stages. We will try to
                        diversify each group&rsquo;s composition where it makes sense.</p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Are MIT Circles mainly for folks who work in tech?</span>
                    <p>We intend to make MIT Circles diverse to enable a more interesting experience for everyone. As a
                        part of that, we encourage all kinds of professions and backgrounds to apply.</p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Who are the Leads and how are they chosen?</span>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:0">Leads will be selected first and foremost based on their willingness to
                        accept the responsibilities and invest the additional time and effort that is needed to be an
                        effective Lead. If you express interest in being a Lead, the program administrators will reach
                        out with more information.</p>

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">What does a typical meeting look like?</span>
                    <p>During group meetings, participants will take turns sharing a personal or professional experience
                        or challenge, which the other members of the circle will respond to with questions, advice, and
                        their own reflections. The group may also choose a specific theme to focus on and have a
                        participant present on a relevant situation to set up the discussion. We will provide reference
                        content and suggestions to help the group shape the style that works best for its members.

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">What do people talk about in Circles?</span>
                    <p>Meeting structure and topics of discussion vary greatly from group to group, but they can include
                        any issues facing us these days, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Career management (e.g. planning, progression, pivots, reentering the workplace)
                        </li>
                        <li>Communication (e.g. for different scenarios and audiences, speaking up, conflict resolution,
                            negotiation)
                        </li>
                        <li>Organizational dynamics (e.g. cross-functional navigation, influence, managing up,
                            unconscious bias)
                        </li>
                        <li>People management (e.g. coaching, motivation, hiring, performance management)
                        </li>
                        <li>Professional development (e.g. executive presence, personal brand, imposter syndrome,
                            emotional intelligence)
                        </li>
                        <li>Business challenges (e.g. strategy, decision-making, business acumen)
                        </li>
                        <li>Personal challenges (e.g. work/family balance, burnout, self-care, relationships)
                        </li>
                        <li>Expand network (e.g. connect with other MIT alums)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Where are Circles meetings held? How does the group meet virtually?</span>
                    <p>Given the current situation, it is recommended that Circles conduct their meetings virtually
                        (e.g., via Zoom or Google Meet). In the future, this may change, as in-person meetings confer
                        significant advantages in terms of immediacy, focus, etc. amongst participants.</p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">How often will my group meet and for how long?</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Initial meeting:</strong> For the first 2-3 sessions, it is recommended that the
                            group meet weekly for one hour each time (or have 1 extended session). This will enable the
                            group members to get to know one another and build the trust foundations to get things
                            going.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Ongoing meetings:</strong> Thereafter, the group will determine specific meeting
                            dates and times, with the recommendation being bi-weekly meetings of one hour each. Exact
                            timing/dates will be based on the group members' availabilities, but consistent attendance
                            is required. This will enable the group to build deep relationships and drive meaningful
                            discussions.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Circles groups will run for a trial period of about one
                            six-month, after which each group will decide whether it wants to continue meeting or
                            reshuffle with other groups.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Maintaining continuity:</strong> Canceling a meeting can and most probably will have
                            a negative effect on the members&rsquo; ability to reconnect. In general, it is advised to
                            go through with a planned meeting as long as at least 50% of the group is present.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">What happens if I miss a session?</span>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:0">Consistent attendance is expected of all MIT Circles participants in
                        order to maximize the value for participants. If you need to miss a session, please inform your
                        Circle as soon as possible. Circle Leads will be asked to reach out to participants that miss
                        more than 1 session out of the first few (or tend to be late / leave early) and those
                        participants may be removed from the Circle at the program administrators&rsquo; discretion.</p>

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">My schedule is unpredictable so I can&rsquo;t commit to attending all or most meetings. Can I still join?</span>
                    <p>Participants are expected to join for all sessions barring extenuating circumstances - this
                        ensures a sense of mutual respect and support. After all, the value of MIT Circles is driven by
                        active engagement and participation, so showing up consistently is a key to success.</p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Are there specific norms that participants are expected to respect?</span>
                    <p>Yes, participants are expected to respect a set of norms that include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Avoid sharing any information or observations shared
                            during meetings with non-members, whether colleagues, partners, spouses or friends. This
                            helps to ensure that participants can share openly and honestly and that information is not
                            provided out of context or in a way that might make the sharer uncomfortable about sharing
                            again in the future.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Openness:</strong> Commit to being as open as possible about personal matters with
                            members of the group, with the understanding that everything will be held in strictest
                            confidence. However, please be respectful about not pushing other participants to share
                            beyond their comfort zone on personally sensitive matters.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Join your Circle with the assumption that its members are worthy of
                            trust. Understand that trust is built through honest, open communications and caring for
                            other members of the group.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Full Attention:</strong> Commit to practicing active listening and to avoiding
                            interrupting others while they are speaking.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Withholding Judgement: </strong>Commit to withholding judgement of group members and
                            avoid giving unsolicited advice. Try not to impose your values and beliefs on other members.

                    <p>There is no program participation fee, but participation does require that you are an MIT Club of
                        Northern California member (MITCNC). You can become a member <a
                                href="/membership/join-or-renew/">here</a> ($50/year), and becoming a member will
                        provide you with access to numerous other MITCNC events throughout the year as well.&nbsp;</p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">Who is eligible to participate in the program? What if I've moved away from the Bay Area during the pandemic?</span>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:0">All members of MITCNC who reside, work, or have their life center in
                        NorCal are invited to join. We do prefer MIT Circles to be composed of people that are
                        geographically close to enable future in-person meetings, but this is not a strict requirement
                        (especially given the uncertainty of the current situation).</p>

                    <p>Yes, once Circles are in motion, they will run together until the end of the cohort. Oftentimes,
                        some of the most interesting conversations for Circles arise in the context of inflection points
                        / transitions that participants are making.</p>

                    <p>We will admit applicants based on their expressed commitment to the program and our ability to
                        match them with a Circle that matches their interests. The first Circles cohort will have a
                        limited scope because it is a pilot (both due to logistical factors and in order to maximize
                        testing objectives). We cannot guarantee everyone's participation.</p>

                        Leads do take on additional responsibilities to help ensure that their Circles run smoothly and
                        effectively.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>Facilitate the meetings: During meetings, Leads are expected to help the group bond, align
                            on goals/regular schedule/norms, and stay on track. That being said, there are no strict
                            requirements on curriculum to cover and over time we expect facilitation needs to become
                            minimal. Circles operate on a voluntary, collaborative model where everyone is expected to
                            pitch in to support the group&rsquo;s activities. We will also provide the needed guidance
                            and content to support the Leads.
